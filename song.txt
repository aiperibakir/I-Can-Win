It's so hard to explain
What I'm feeling
But I guess it's ok
Cause I'll keep believing
There's something deep inside
Something that's calling
It's calling you and I
It's taking us up high

Healing,
A simple act of kindness bring such meaning
A smile can change a life let's start believing
And feeling, let's start healing
Heal and you will be healed
Break every border
Give and you will receive
It's nature's order
There is a hidden force
Pulling us closer
It's pulling you and I
It's pulling us up high to...

Healing,
A simple act of kindness brings such meaning
A smile can change a life lets start believing
And feeling, let's start healing
Hearts in the hand of another heart
And in God's hand are all hearts
An eye takes care of another eye
And from God's eye nothing hides
Seek only to give and you'll receive
So, heal and you will be healed
