It's so hard to explain
What I'm feeling
But I guess it's ok
Cause I'll keep believing
There's something deep inside
Something that's calling
It's calling you and I
It's taking us up high
Healing,
A simple act of kindness bring such meaning
A smile can change a life let's start believing
And feeling, let's start healing
